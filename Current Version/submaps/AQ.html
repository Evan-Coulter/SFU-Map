		<h1>Academic Quadrangle</h1>

			<p>
					Located at the heart of SFU, the Academic Quadrangle is a beautiful sight. Designed to render the Canadian landscape, each area of the AQ was built with a part of the Canadian environment in mind. The large hill was reminiscent of the Rockies, the trees, the forests and the pond was created to mirror the many lakes that are important to the Canadian ecosystem. Inside however the AQ is home to many lecture halls, computer labs and classrooms.
