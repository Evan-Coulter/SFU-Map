Map Implementation,
- Currently we plan to use fixed background images as maps and add buttons overtop of them for functionality. 
- We also currently plan to use the standard SFU burnaby map from sfu.ca, we should make sure to cite this if its neccessary.
  If we can't then we can always make a new one ourselves in applications such as inDesign from adobe.
- Users will click on butttons that link to a new html page that follows a similar format as the main map page.
- However, this requires that we make our pages fixed. This isn't so bad as it allows us more control over placing our buttons
  and divs using "hard code" pixels. One drawback of this is that it requires the user to use our pages at full-sized browsers.
  But, we plan to handle this with a start page where we let he user know to keep their browser in full size.
  
Start Page Implementation,
- We can just make something simple and nice to look at that welcomes the user, lets them know to use full-sized browsers, 
  and has a big button that links to the main map page.
